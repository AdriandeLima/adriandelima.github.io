      <description>Towards the end of 2019, my little brother Adrian played in a concert starring Jaime Jorge, a well-known Adventist musician with a music ministry that takes him around the world. The concert was organised by Pastor James Shepley of Cheltenham Seventh-Day Adventist Church.
I was studying at Newbold College of Higher Education on the Year In Mission program, and decided to drive down to see the concert with my friend and classmate Jan.</description>
