      <description>Malotte&amp;rsquo;s The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer Composed in 1935 by Albert Hay Malotte, The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer sets the classic prayer given by Christ in Matthew 6 to song. This rendition is sung by my father, with myself at the piano.
Lyrics: Our Father, Which art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come Thy will be done, On earth As it is In Heaven. Give us this day, Our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we Forgive our debtors.</description>
