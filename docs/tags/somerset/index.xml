      <description>An arrangement of the popular Christmas song &amp;ldquo;Mary did you know?&amp;rdquo; performed by myself and my brother Kevin.
Merry Crimble everyone!
Lyrics Mary did you know That your baby boy Would one day walk on water? Mary did you know That your baby boy Would save our sons and daughters? Did you know That your baby boy Has come to make you new? This child that you&amp;#39;ve delivered Will soon deliver you Mary did you know That your baby boy Would give sight to a blind man?</description>
