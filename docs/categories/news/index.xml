      <description>Welcome to Adrian de Lima&amp;rsquo;s new website Hello world, and welcome to my new portfolio website. My name is Adrian Ethan de Lima, and I am an expert musician based in the UK. Following my studies at the University of Birmingham, I thought it would be handy to showcase music for you all on a website.
I got my brother Darthagnon of Machine Men to make me a website, following earlier discussions around Christmas.</description>

      <description>Living much of his life in Dresden, Dahl never forgot his Norwegian homeland, basing a lot of his landscape work off of his memories of the landscape and trips home (jonathan5485, 2011). His Mother and Child by the Sea was painted during a difficult time in his life, not long after the deaths of a lot of his family, and the same year that his great friend and inspiration Caspar Friedrich passed away.</description>
