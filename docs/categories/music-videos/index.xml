      <description>An evening of concert featuring Lalo &amp;amp; Bridge by Adrian de Lima and Toby Baker at Wylde Green United Reformed Church.
On 16th Feb 2025, I performed a selection of minatures by Frank Bridge, and Lalo&amp;rsquo;s Symphony Espagnole, at Wylde Green United Reformed Church. Many thanks to all who came to support, to my accompanist, colleague and friend Toby Baker, and the team at Wylde Green and UoB Music, for the opportunity to put on this programme, we had an awesome time!</description>

      <description>Malotte&amp;rsquo;s The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer Composed in 1935 by Albert Hay Malotte, The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer sets the classic prayer given by Christ in Matthew 6 to song. This rendition is sung by my father, with myself at the piano.
Lyrics: Our Father, Which art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come Thy will be done, On earth As it is In Heaven. Give us this day, Our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we Forgive our debtors.</description>
