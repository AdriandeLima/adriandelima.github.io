My name is Adrian Ethan de Lima, and I am an expert musician based in the UK. Following my studies at the University of Birmingham, I thought it would be handy to showcase music for you all on a website.

Merry Crimble everyone!

      <description>Living much of his life in Dresden, Dahl never forgot his Norwegian homeland, basing a lot of his landscape work off of his memories of the landscape and trips home (jonathan5485, 2011). His Mother and Child by the Sea was painted during a difficult time in his life, not long after the deaths of a lot of his family, and the same year that his great friend and inspiration Caspar Friedrich passed away.</description>

      <description>Malotte&amp;rsquo;s The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer Composed in 1935 by Albert Hay Malotte, The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer sets the classic prayer given by Christ in Matthew 6 to song. This rendition is sung by my father, with myself at the piano.
Lyrics: Our Father,Which art in heaven,Hallowed beThy name,Thy kingdom comeThy will be done,On earthAs it isIn Heaven.Give us this day,Our daily bread.And forgive us our debts,As weForgive our debtors.</description>
