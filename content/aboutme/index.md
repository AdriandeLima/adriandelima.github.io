Music has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. I was fortunate enough to have parents brave enough to sacrifice their time, money (and ears) for me to be heavily involved in music making throughout my childhood, taking violin and piano lessons at a local music school in Mallorca, Spain where we were living at the time. Upon moving to the UK, I continued my studies of music at secondary school, leading pursuit of my passion at the University of Birmingham where I graduated with my bachelor’s in music in 2025, specializing in performance and electronic composition. 

My journey into music technology began during a period working as a performing arts technician at my old school. Going in with little to no experience in sound tech, I quickly learned that there’s more to a microphone than just plugging it in, and that sparked an ongoing fascination with sound design and recording. Since then, I’ve been mixing, composing, and experimenting with tech to bring my ideas to life, going so far as to structure a majority of my degree around recording and manipulating sound.

What really drives me is sharing my music with others and providing the means for music to inspire them. I believe in everyone should have the opportunity to follow their dream and think there’s something incredibly rewarding about supporting others in pursuing their passions, whether it's through collaboration, mentorship, or just sharing knowledge along the way.
