An arrangement of the popular Christmas song "Mary did you know?" performed by myself and my brother Kevin.

Merry Crimble everyone!

## Lyrics 

```
Mary did you know
That your baby boy
Would one day walk on water?
Mary did you know
That your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters?

Did you know
That your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you

Mary did you know
That your baby boy
Would give sight to a blind man?
Mary did you know
Your baby boy
Would calm a storm with his hand?

Did you know
That your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod?
When your kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God

The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb

Mary did you know
That your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know
That your baby boy
Would one day rule the nations?

Did you know
That your baby boy
Is Heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding
Is the great I am
```
