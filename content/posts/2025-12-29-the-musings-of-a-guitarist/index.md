I was greatly inspired by the work of Monty Adkins’ in ‘Five Panels no.1 For
Luke’ and his manipulation of resonant materials. Determined to compose
a piece in a similar style, I decided on guitar harmonics as a basis. My piece
opens with fairly unaltered natural harmonics, played on an acoustic guitar,
which then transitions to an electric guitar, with increased alterations to
the sound. I experimented a lot with bringing sound material in and out of
focus by repeating melodic material with a narrower frequency spectrum,
so that the piece progresses from clean opening harmonics, to a hazy wash
of conflicting harmonic sounds towards the end. As a contrast to this wash
of sound, I used different timbral elements of the guitar, such as tapping the
body, or playing above the nut to create a more percussive texture.
