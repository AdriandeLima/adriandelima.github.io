This composition is my end of 2nd year project at the University of Birmingham. It uses a variety of recorded harmonic sounds that are manipulated to create an atmospheric piece in the style of Monty Adkins.


## Compositional Notes

At the time of composing I was greatly inspired by the work of Monty Adkins in his [first of five panels](https://open.spotify.com/track/091QEyR5dVu060wTiUWdOG?si=046ac0c7027045d7) entitled *For Luke*. Determined to compose a piece in a similar style, I decided on guitar harmonics as a basis. 

*The Musings of a Guitarist* opens with fairly unaltered natural harmonics, played on an acoustic guitar, which then transitions to an electric guitar, with increased alterations to
the sound. I experimented a lot with bringing sound material in and out of focus by repeating melodic material with a narrower frequency spectrum. This allows the piece to progress from clean opening harmonics, to a hazy wash of conflicting harmonic sounds towards the end. As a contrast to this wash of sound, I used different timbral elements of the guitar, such as tapping the body, or playing above the nut to create a more percussive texture.
