Moon River composed by Henry Mancini with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, here arranged by Denny Wang and performed by Adrian de Lima and Toby Baker.

We performed this piece to celebrate graduating from the University of Birmingham, featuring the university's iconic clock tower Old Joe playing the role of the moon.

I hope you enjoy!

Lyrics:

```
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday (Someday, day)
A dream maker (Maker, maker)
My heartbreaker (You heartbreaker)
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' that way (The same, the same)
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasin' after all the same
Chasin' after our ends
Moon river, wider than a mile
Crossin' in style someday
My dream maker, heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' the same
Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world, you'll see (What I see, who I become)
(What I see, who I become)
We're all chasin' after our ends
Chasin' after our ends
Life's just around the bend, my friend
Moon river and me
```
