Throughout his musical career, Adrian de Lima has successfully passed many exams according to the standards set by both the Spanish and British music boards. He started his musical studies with private piano lessons in Sóller, Mallorca, before continuing with violin and piano at the [Escola Municipal de Música de Sóller](https://alumnes.musicasoller.com/index.html). Upon return to the UK, he continued his studies privately in piano and violin under the standards set by the [ABRSM](https://www.abrsm.org/en-gb) (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music).
