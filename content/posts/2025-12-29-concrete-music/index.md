Reflective Listening Journal
I find the concept of manipulating a sound beyond its original natural shape
fascinating, especially the idea of extending the resonance of a sound long past its natural
decay. The notion of creating impossible sounds has been very influential in my
compositional journey, as I have strived to create contrast between the “real” and the
impossible, by manipulating recognisable sounds to no longer conform to their physical
limitations.
Dirk Stromberg’s Rising Tones is a piece composed using source sounds emitted by
radio telescopes. Stromberg focuses mainly on rising spectral tonal material throughout the
piece, creating a sound that can seemingly rise infinitely. This pitched material acts as a
drone which gradually oscillates by varying the rate at which it pans left and right, coming in
and out of phase with itself.
About halfway through, a bass frequency which behaves like a shepherd tone is
introduced, always rising, but never reaching the top. This tone eventually settles, as a new
textural material of granulized, shimmering bells takes over the rising pitch.
The piece gradually fades out at the end, implying that these tones continue to rise
beyond the scope of human hearing. I really like the way Stromberg uses an abstract sound
and manipulates it to become impossible by the laws of physics, never reaching a peak,
while still keeping a sense of familiarity by obeying the limitations of human hearing.
Another piece that plays around with our sense of hearing is Michael Pisaro’s Still
Life with Cicadas, Waterfall and Radu, which consists of field recordings of natural sounds
such as cicadas, and silence. I appreciate how Pisaro combines simple sounds to create a
complex texture that can paint a vivid picture in the mind. It is also interesting how he
creates such an unnatural space by the sounds’ movement.
The piece begins with just the sound of one cicada, with none of the background
noise one would normally associate with them. The cicada’s sound periodically cuts to
complete silence, returning in a different location, an effect which acts like the insect is
teleporting to different positions in a vacuum. About 1.30 a tinnitus-like hum is introduced,
which creates the impression that the silence has become too much to bear and now the
brain is filling in the perceived missing noise. This is further emphasized when at about 2.30
the sound of rushing water is introduced. The picture builds, with hums, cicadas, crickets,
running water and traffic all painting an image of what silence might sound like to an ear
that fills in the void of sound with repetitive background noise. This material gets all
layered together at 4.30 to create a collage of background noise which grows to become
unbearable due to its deafening volume, and conflicting harsh frequencies. At 6.00 a
resonant electronic sound is added as a more “musical” element, acting as some kind of
background drone, like the electrical hum of a ground loop, creating some kind of
underlying bass element to the more recognisable natural sounds.
Francis Dhomont’s work Forêt Profunde has also been quite influential to my
compositional process, especially the movements Chambre interdite and Musique de
chambre. Chambre interdite or Forbidden Room is aptly named for its use of door sounds. It
opens with a very close, dry, opening door, which then suddenly cuts to an frozen
2188230
abstraction of the sound, creating a lovely contrast between the recognisable sound of a
door, and its manipulated clone. Dhomont uses a lot of freeze, reverb and stretch FX in this
movement, as a way of creating impossible spaces. While Still Life focuses on impossible
movements of sound, Dhomont creates unnatural spatial atmospheres. At 0.47 there’s an
interesting transition between spaces, as a creaky door with a lot of reverb sharply cuts to a
completely different atmosphere which sounds like some roomy far away location.
Dhomont emphasizes the contrast between these spaces by these quick, unnatural cuts, an
effect I have found to be inspirational in my own work.
Musique de chambre or Chamber Music uses instrumental sounds as a basis, with a
dissonant and busy texture of pizzicato strings creating a chaotic atmosphere throughout
the movement. Instead of disarraying the strings by the use of FX, he uses a chaotic
arrangement of the material itself to abstract its sound, so it is difficult to tell which
instruments are playing what. Out of this chaos emerges a peaceful piano solo, as a moment
of calm in a storm. This material is parodied at the end of the movement by a detuned
piano, which is layered with an extreme delay, causing it to quickly devolve into a chaotic
texture similar to the initial pizz strings. I found this contrast between the peaceful,
unedited melodies, and the chaotic textures to be quite satisfying, and have attempted to
subtly enrich my own compositions in a similar way.
Five Panels no. 1 for Luke by Monty Adkins has also been a huge inspiration for my
compositional process. The piece contrasts complex granulated textures with the pure clean
tones of guitar harmonics in a simple melody. Five Panels is a fantastic example of Adkins’
compositional style of balancing timbre, tone and texture. Each piece focuses heavily on rich
and soft resonant material with underlying granulated textures that keep the slow-moving
tonal material interesting.
No. 1 was especially inspirational to me because of the way the natural guitar
harmonics gradually become more abstracted over the course of the piece, with the
reverberating tails of the notes extended to create a wash of sound. I love the way the initial
background texture gradually increases in layers and overtakes the harmonics, while in
contrast the harmonics swap roles and replace the granulated material as a background
texture. I also like how Adkins maintains the underlying calm of the opening harmonics
throughout the piece, in spite of the increase in agitation in the textural material. Gradually,
this agitated texture that has taken the forefront diminishes, leaving a long, pure, harmonic
that is reminiscent of the opening purity of the piece.

Memory Etching by Monty Adkins
This piece uses a lot of long sonorous textures, with bell-like sounds creating interesting
gestural elements that emerge out of these textures. There’s a variety of sound sources,
such as wind chimes, music boxes and rattling glass objects, but these get obfuscated over
the course of the piece. Adkins creates interesting, randomised, rhythmical elements, which
I suspect is achieved by freezing and shuffling the tails of some of the sound sources. He also
does a really good job exploring the full frequency range.

Memory Box by Monty Adkins
Created with mostly music box sounds, this piece has a very nostalgic atmosphere to it.
There’s an underlying texture, as of someone turning the music box, which has a lot of
reverb on it to extend the decay of the bells. As the piece progresses, more
abstracted/edited elements are added to the piece, defocusing the original music box.
Forensic Embers by Monty Adkins
This piece has a more ominous atmosphere. It explores bass tones, with some ethereal
string like sounds over the top. There, long held tones are accompanied by more granular
textural sounds, which add some attack to otherwise fairly static textures. An organ is added
about half-way through the piece, to tie the various timbres together, and create some
harmony.
Radiant Moon by Monty Adkins
This piece is similar to Memory Box, in that it focuses on the bell like qualities of a music
box, but Adkins makes liberal use of vinyl player noise and static, which creates a lovely
crunchy texture, with a retro feel.
Für Alina by Arvo Pärt
This isn’t a piece of electro acoustic music, but it really fits the style of music I’m inspired by
for my composition. It explores the timbral elements of the piano, playing with its bell-like
sound qualities. Pärt uses the sustain pedal to create a wash of texture by the overtones
that come through when holding the pedal down, which I think is a really interesting and
underused technique.
Clockwork Cities by Monty Adkins
This piece makes use of freeze a lot, freezing the decaying notes of a guitar to create
textural elements, accompanied by the occasional attack of the beginning of a new note in
typical Adkins style. For some of his material he clearly doesn’t try to hide the loop point so
that it creates a rhythmical element. He also shuffles various sound elements around to
create movement by increasing the chaotic nature of the textures. There’s an interesting
use of taps, and various string sounds, which are obfuscated by layering them in such a way
that they seem to be mechanical, like the insides of a clock working.
