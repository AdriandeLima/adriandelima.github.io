An evening of concert featuring Lalo & Bridge by Adrian de Lima and Toby Baker at [Wylde Green United Reformed Church].

{{< youtube zmYXOCynG8A >}}

As a final year performance student at the University of Birmingham, you're offered the opportunity to perform at a local church in Wylde Green. It's a fantastic opportunity to practice your recital repertoire, so I decided to take advantage of it. 

On 16th Feb 2025, I performed a selection of minatures by Frank Bridge, and Lalo's Symphony Espagnole to an audience of about 30. It was a great time, despite the cold. 

Many thanks to all who came to support, to my accompanist, my friend Toby Baker, and the team at Wylde Green and UoB Music, for the opportunity to put on this programme, we had an awesome time!

The recording was done unofficially by my mother.
