Merry Christmas!

We hope you enjoy our rendition of the popular carol See Amid the Winter Snow, arranged by yours truly. This carol is very special to me, having performed it at my first Christmas carol concert in secondary school. 

Many thanks to my brother Kevin for helping put this together, despite being on different continents and time zones! This year I'm spending Christmas in Brazil, while Kevin's still Europe based, hence the contrast in climates in this video 😂

I had a blast arranging this carol for string quartet. Shoutout to our digital twins for helping fill it out.

## Lyrics
```
1. See, amid the winter's snow,
born for us on earth below,
see the tender Lamb appears,
promised from eternal years.

Refrain:
Hail, thou ever blessed morn!
Hail, redemption's happy dawn!
Sing through all Jerusalem,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."

2. Lo, within a manger lies
He who built the starry skies;
He who, throned in height sublime,
sits amid the cherubim! [Refrain]
3 Say, ye holy shepherds, say,
what's your joyful news today?
Wherefore have ye left your sheep
on the lonely mountain steep? [Refrain]

4. "As we watched at dead of night,
Lo! we saw a wondrous light;
angels singing 'Peace on earth'
told us of the Savior's birth." [Refrain]

5. Sacred Infant, all divine,
what a tender love was Thine,
thus to come from highest bliss
down to such a world as this! [Refrain]

6. Teach, O teach us, Holy Child,
by Thy face so meek and mild,
teach us to resemble Thee,
in Thy sweet humility! [Refrain]
```
