## Malotte's The Lord's Prayer

</div>
<!-- FM:Snippet:End -->


{{< youtube NY3XLQo9Foo >}}

Composed in 1935 by Albert Hay Malotte, The Lord's Prayer sets the classic prayer given by Christ in Matthew 6 to song. This rendition is sung by my father, with myself at the piano.

This song has a lot of history in my family. My father orginally learned it to perform with my mother at the piano. Then my brother took over, before I myself learned the piece (safe to say, Dad's been performing this song a long time).
I'd always wanted to do a project with him, and finally convinced him to give this a go. This project also served to wet my feet in video editing.

## Lyrics

```
Our Father,
Which art in heaven,
Hallowed be
Thy name,
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done,
On earth
As it is
In Heaven.
Give us this day,
Our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
As we
Forgive our debtors.
And lead us not
Into temptation.
But deliver us from evil.
For thine
Is the Kingdom,
And the power,
And the glory,
Forever,
Amen.
```
