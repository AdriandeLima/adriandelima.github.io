Towards the end of 2019, my little brother Adrian played in a concert starring [Jaime Jorge](https://www.jaimejorge.com/), a well-known [Adventist](https://adventist.org/) musician with a music ministry that takes him around the world. The concert was organised by Pastor James Shepley of Cheltenham Seventh-Day Adventist Church. 

I was studying at [Newbold College of Higher Education](https://www.newbold.ac.uk/) on the [Year In Mission](https://www.newbold.ac.uk/courses/one-year-in-mission-and-service/) program, and decided to drive down to see the concert with my friend and classmate Jan. It was a bit of a long drive from Binfield (near Reading), but we had BBC Radio 3 and [For the Ones by Yelfris Valdés](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ3xkgUqjdY&list=PL4PBIkIu5AtjUKdyeBIFqSujWlZOlgoWY&index=2) to keep us company. 

The concert was very nice, with my little brother Adrian and friends from the youth of Cheltenham church backing Jaime Jorge for a few pieces, and it was great to see family again for the first time in a few months. I distinctly remember Mum got her car locked behind a gate because parking was a bit funny there.
