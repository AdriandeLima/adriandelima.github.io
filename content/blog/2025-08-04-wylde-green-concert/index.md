An evening of concert featuring Lalo & Bridge by Adrian de Lima and Toby Baker at [Wylde Green United Reformed Church].

{{< youtube biGn7NGZfX8 >}}

On 16th Feb 2025, I performed a selection of minatures by Frank Bridge, and Lalo's Symphony Espagnole, at Wylde Green United Reformed Church. Many thanks to all who came to support, to my accompanist, colleague and friend Toby Baker, and the team at Wylde Green and UoB Music, for the opportunity to put on this programme, we had an awesome time!
