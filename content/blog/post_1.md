# Welcome to Adrian de Lima's new website

Hello world, and welcome to my new portfolio website. My name is Adrian Ethan de Lima, and I am an expert musician based in the UK. Following my studies at the University of Birmingham, I thought it would be handy to showcase music for you all on a website.

I got my brother [Darthagnon](https://github.com/Darthagnon/) of [Machine Men](https://robot-one.github.io/) to make me a website, following earlier discussions around Christmas. I will be using this as an opportunity to learn static website development after earlier experiments at university with Wordpress blogging.

Our technology stack is [Hugo v118.1], the [Aafu] theme and [Github Pages] (my website source code is hosted opensource on [GitHub at adrianelima.github.io]). We are using an older release of Hugo, because newer versions focus on adding themes package-manager style as [Hugo Modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/); package managers and the Linux style of software management are evil, unnecessarily complicated and a form of online-only DRM. We are using an older release of the Aafu theme so we don't need to worry about dependency bloat added since (e.g. [nodeJS] and [TailwindCSS] dependencies, which I don't want to maintain as unnecessary complications). 

I will be adding [Darth's Hugo Shortcodes] so that I can embed music scores, PDFs, photo galleries and music more easily on my website, and I will probably ask Darthagnon to fork and improve the Aafu theme so that it looks more "musical" and to fix the incorrect MM-DD-YYYY date formatting.

The domain name might change soon; we earlier tested the website as Adrian's (Concert) Hall, a pun off [Hadrian's Wall](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/hadrians-wall), on https://adrianshall.github.io, before deciding to simplify.
