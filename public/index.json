His Mother and Child by the Sea was painted during a difficult time in his life, not long after the deaths of a lot of his family, and the same year that his great friend and inspiration Caspar Friedrich passed away. Some see the work as a homage to his friend, or as a reference to his own childhood, waiting for his father to return from his fishing trips (‘Johan Christian Dahl (1788–1857)’, 2012).\nDahl, Johan Christian Clausen; Mother and Child by the Sea; The Barber Institute of Fine Arts; http://www.artuk.org/artworks/mother-and-child-by-the-sea-33070\nThe painting is on a small canvas, in a way inviting the viewer in for a closer, more intimate viewing experience. It depicts the silhouettes a woman and child waiting for a fishing boat to return. I really love the contrast between the cold moonlight and the shadowy landscape, as it leaves a lot of the details of the scene up to one’s imagination. The child appears to be excited, but we can’t tell what the mother’s attitude is and there’s no way of knowing whether the trip has been successful or not.\nIn my own compositional response to the painting I want to create an impression of a natural landscape from sampled sounds, and then, similarly to how Dahl uses light to obscure details and ignite the imagination, abstract the sonic landscape with further processing.\nAdrian de Lima · Some source sounds\nSources # jonathan5485, A.

I was fortunate enough to have parents brave enough to sacrifice their time, money (and ears) for me to be heavily involved in music making throughout my childhood, taking violin and piano lessons at a local music school in Mallorca, Spain where we were living at the time. Upon moving to the UK, I continued my studies of music at secondary school, leading pursuit of my passion at the University of Birmingham where I graduated with my bachelor’s in music in 2025, specializing in performance and electronic composition.\nMy journey into music technology began during a period working as a performing arts technician at my old school. Going in with little to no experience in sound tech, I quickly learned that there’s more to a microphone than just plugging it in, and that sparked an ongoing fascination with sound design and recording. Since then, I’ve been mixing, composing, and experimenting with tech to bring my ideas to life, going so far as to structure a majority of my degree around recording and manipulating sound.\nWhat really drives me is sharing my music with others and providing the means for music to inspire them. I believe in everyone should have the opportunity to follow their dream and think there’s something incredibly rewarding about supporting others in pursuing their passions, whether it\u0026rsquo;s through collaboration, mentorship, or just sharing knowledge along the way.\nCheck out my work here Contact Me ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/aboutme/","section":"Home page blurb","summary":"","title":"About me","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/about-me/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/adrian-de-lima/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Adrian De Lima","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/composer/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Composer","type":"tags"},{"content":"If you would like to get in touch with me, you can find me at the following socials:\nInstagram LinkedIn My music can be found on the following platforms:\nYoutube Soundcloud Spotify Or for business/booking enquiries, email me below:\nEmail me ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"Home page blurb","summary":"","title":"Contact page","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/musician/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Musician","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pianist/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pianist","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/violinist/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Violinist","type":"tags"}]
