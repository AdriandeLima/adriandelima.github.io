I was fortunate enough to have parents brave enough to sacrifice their time, money (and ears) in order for me to be heavily involved in music making throughout my childhood, and this naturally blossomed into a pursuit of my passion at UoB. My journey into music technology began during a stint as a performing arts technician. I quickly learned that there’s more to a microphone than just plugging it in, and that sparked an ongoing fascination with sound design and recording. Since then, I’ve been mixing, composing, and experimenting with tech to bring my ideas to life. What really drives me, though, is sharing my music with others, and providing the means for music to inspire them. There\u0026rsquo;s something incredibly rewarding about supporting others in pursuing their passions, whether it\u0026rsquo;s through collaboration, mentorship, or just sharing knowledge along the way.\n","date":"29 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home page blurb","summary":"","title":"Home page blurb","type":"page"},{"content":" Moon River composed by Henry Mancini with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, here arranged by Denny Wang and performed by Adrian de Lima and Toby Baker.\nWe performed this piece to celebrate graduating from the University of Birmingham, featuring the university\u0026rsquo;s iconic clock tower Old Joe playing the role of the moon.\nI hope you enjoy!\nSocials:\n/adriandelima.music https://adriandelima.github.io/ @AdriandelimaMusic @tobyb1506 @nicolegisbourne Lyrics:\nMoon river, wider than a mile I\u0026#39;m crossing you in style someday (Someday, day) A dream maker (Maker, maker) My heartbreaker (You heartbreaker) Wherever you\u0026#39;re goin\u0026#39;, I\u0026#39;m goin\u0026#39; that way (The same, the same) Two drifters off to see the world There\u0026#39;s such a crazy world to see We\u0026#39;re all chasin\u0026#39; after all the same Chasin\u0026#39; after our ends Moon river, wider than a mile Crossin\u0026#39; in style someday My dream maker, heartbreaker Wherever you\u0026#39;re goin\u0026#39;, I\u0026#39;m goin\u0026#39; the same Two drifters off to see the world It\u0026#39;s such a crazy world, you\u0026#39;ll see (What I see, who I become) (What I see, who I become) We\u0026#39;re all chasin\u0026#39; after our ends Chasin\u0026#39; after our ends Life\u0026#39;s just around the bend, my friend Moon river and me Featured Comments # Many thanks to all those who helped me put this one together, Toby, Nicole, Tevin, Noa.

His Mother and Child by the Sea was painted during a difficult time in his life, not long after the deaths of a lot of his family, and the same year that his great friend and inspiration Caspar Friedrich passed away. Some see the work as a homage to his friend, or as a reference to his own childhood, waiting for his father to return from his fishing trips (‘Johan Christian Dahl (1788–1857)’, 2012).\nDahl, Johan Christian Clausen; Mother and Child by the Sea; The Barber Institute of Fine Arts; http://www.artuk.org/artworks/mother-and-child-by-the-sea-33070\nThe painting is on a small canvas, in a way inviting the viewer in for a closer, more intimate viewing experience. It depicts the silhouettes a woman and child waiting for a fishing boat to return. I really love the contrast between the cold moonlight and the shadowy landscape, as it leaves a lot of the details of the scene up to one’s imagination. The child appears to be excited, but we can’t tell what the mother’s attitude is and there’s no way of knowing whether the trip has been successful or not.\nIn my own compositional response to the painting I want to create an impression of a natural landscape from sampled sounds, and then, similarly to how Dahl uses light to obscure details and ignite the imagination, abstract the sonic landscape with further processing.\nAdrian de Lima · Some source sounds\nSources # jonathan5485, A.
