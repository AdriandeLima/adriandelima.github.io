These pieces were written as compositional exercises while studying studio composition at the University of Birmingham. They were composed individually, but I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to include combine them here as an album, since the thematic material is fairly similar. The title of the album is an obvious play on words on the style the pieces are written in.\nWhat is Musique Concrète? # Musique Concrète is a style of music that involves recording everyday sounds, and abstracting their origins, so that the listener can\u0026rsquo;t tell what source the sounds come from. There\u0026rsquo;s a heavy focus on the raw material of sound, and on manipulating sound in inovative ways, less on traditional melodic material.\nEach piece in the album focuses on an everyday object or material, which I recorded in a studio setting and manipulated into the compositions using REAPER DAW and various plugins from GRM.\nAlongside learning how to use REAPER to manipulate sound, the studio composition module at UoB involved a considerable amount of listening work. Each week we would listen to a variety of compositions from other composers in the field, and write our thoughts in a reflective listening journal. I\u0026rsquo;ve included those thoughts here.\nReflective Listening Journal # I find the concept of manipulating a sound beyond its original natural shape fascinating, especially the idea of extending the resonance of a sound long past its natural decay. The notion of creating impossible sounds has been very influential in my compositional journey, as I have strived to create contrast between the “real” and the impossible, by manipulating recognisable sounds to no longer conform to their physical limitations.\nDirk Stromberg Rising Tones # Dirk Stromberg’s Rising Tones is a piece composed using source sounds emitted by radio telescopes. Stromberg focuses mainly on rising pectral tonal material throughout the piece, creating a sound that can seemingly rise infinitely. This pitched material acts as a drone which gradually oscillates by varying the rate at which it pans left and right, coming in and out of phase with itself. About halfway through the piece, a bass frequency which behaves like a shepherd tone is introduced, always rising, but never reaching the top. This tone eventually settles, as a new textural material of granulized, shimmering bells takes over the rising pitch. The piece gradually fades out at the end, implying that these tones continue to rise beyond the scope of human hearing.\nI really like the way Stromberg uses an abstract sound and manipulates it to become impossible by the laws of physics, never reaching a peak, while still keeping a sense of familiarity by obeying the limitations of human hearing.\nMichael Pisaro Still Life with Cicadas # An album that plays around with our sense of hearing is Michael Pisaro’s Still Life with Cicadas, Waterfall and Radu, which consists of field recordings of natural sounds such from cicadas, and silence. I appreciate how Pisaro combines simple sounds to create a complex texture that can paint a vivid picture in the mind. It is also interesting how he creates such an unnatural space by the sounds’ movement.\nThe 2nd track of the album begins with the sound of just one cicada, with none of the background noise one would normally associate with them. The cicada’s sound periodically cuts to complete silence, returning in a different location, an effect which acts like the insect is teleporting to different positions in a vacuum. About 1.30 a tinnitus-like hum is introduced, which creates the impression that the silence has become too much to bear and now the brain is filling in the perceived missing noise. This is further emphasized when at about 2.30 the sound of rushing water is introduced.\nThe picture builds, with hums, cicadas, crickets, running water and traffic all painting an image of what silence might sound like to an ear that fills in the void of sound with repetitive background noise. This material gets all layered together at 4.30 to create a collage of background noise which grows to become unbearable due to its deafening volume, and conflicting harsh frequencies. At 6.00 a resonant electronic sound is added as a more “musical” element, acting as some kind of background drone, like the electrical hum of a ground loop, creating some kind of underlying bass element to the more recognisable natural sounds.\nFrancis Dhomont Forêt Profunde # Francis Dhomont’s work Forêt Profunde has also been quite influential to my compositional process, especially the movements Chambre interdite and Musique de chambre.\nChambre interdite or Forbidden Room is aptly named for its use of door sounds. It opens with a very close, dry, opening door, which then suddenly cuts to an frozen abstraction of the sound, creating a lovely contrast between the recognisable sound of a door, and its manipulated clone. Dhomont uses a lot of freeze, reverb and stretch FX in this movement, as a way of creating impossible spaces. While Still Life focuses on impossible movements of sound, Dhomont creates unnatural spatial atmospheres.\nAt 0.47 there’s an interesting transition between spaces, as a creaky door with a lot of reverb sharply cuts to a completely different atmosphere which sounds like some roomy far away location. Dhomont emphasizes the contrast between these spaces by these quick, unnatural cuts, an effect I have found to be inspirational in my own work.\nMusique de chambre or Chamber Music uses instrumental sounds as a basis, with a dissonant and busy texture of pizzicato strings creating a chaotic atmosphere throughout the movement. Instead of disarraying the strings by the use of FX, he uses a chaotic arrangement of the material itself to abstract its sound, so it is difficult to tell which instruments are playing what.\nOut of this chaos emerges a peaceful piano solo, as a moment of calm in a storm. This material is parodied at the end of the movement by a detuned piano, which is layered with an extreme delay, causing it to quickly devolve into a chaotic texture similar to the initial pizz strings.\nHaving found this contrast between the peaceful, unedited melodies, and the chaotic textures to be quite satisfying, I have attempted to subtly enrich my own compositions in a similar way.\nMonty Adkins Five Panels no. 1 To Luke # Five Panels no. 1 to Luke by Monty Adkins has also been a huge inspiration for my compositional process. The piece contrasts complex granulated textures with the pure clean tones of guitar harmonics in a simple melody. Five Panels is a fantastic example of Adkins’ compositional style of balancing timbre, tone and texture. Each piece focuses heavily on rich and soft resonant material with underlying granulated textures that keep the slow-moving tonal material interesting. No. 1 was especially inspirational to me because of the way the natural guitar harmonics gradually become more abstracted over the course of the piece, with the reverberating tails of the notes extended to create a wash of sound.\nI love the way the initial background texture gradually increases in layers and overtakes the harmonics, while in contrast the harmonics swap roles and replace the granulated material as a background texture. I also like how Adkins maintains the underlying calm of the opening harmonics throughout the piece, in spite of the increase in agitation in the textural material. Gradually, this agitated texture that has taken the forefront diminishes, leaving a long, pure, harmonic that is reminiscent of the opening purity of the piece.\nMonty Adkins Memory Etching # This piece uses a lot of long sonorous textures, with bell-like sounds creating interesting gestural elements that emerge out of these textures. There’s a variety of sound sources, such as wind chimes, music boxes and rattling glass objects, but these get obfuscated over the course of the piece.\nAdkins creates interesting, randomised, rhythmical elements, which I suspect is achieved by freezing and shuffling the tails of some of the sound sources. He also does a really good job exploring the full frequency range.\nMonty Adkins Memory Box # Created with mostly music box sounds, this piece has a very nostalgic atmosphere to it. There’s an underlying texture, as of someone turning the music box, which has a lot of reverb on it to extend the decay of the bells. As the piece progresses, more abstracted/edited elements are added to the piece, defocusing the original music box.\nMonty Adkins Forensic Embers # This piece has a more ominous atmosphere. It explores bass tones, with some ethereal string like sounds over the top. There, long held tones are accompanied by more granular textural sounds, which add some attack to otherwise fairly static textures. An organ is added about half-way through the piece, to tie the various timbres together, and create some harmony.\nMonty Adkins Radiant Moon # This piece is similar to Memory Box, in that it focuses on the bell like qualities of a music box, but Adkins makes liberal use of vinyl player noise and static, which creates a lovely crunchy texture, with a retro feel.\nArvo Pärt Für Alina # This isn’t a piece of electro acoustic music, but it really fits the style of music I’m inspired by for my compositions. It explores the timbral elements of the piano, playing with its bell-like sound qualities. Pärt uses the sustain pedal to create a wash of texture by the overtones that come through when holding the pedal down, which I think is a really interesting and underused technique.\nMonty Adkins Clockwork Cities # This piece makes use of freeze a lot, freezing the decaying notes of a guitar to create textural elements, accompanied by the occasional attack of the beginning of a new note in typical Adkins style. For some of his material he clearly doesn’t try to hide the loop point so that it creates a rhythmical element. He also shuffles various sound elements around to create movement by increasing the chaotic nature of the textures. There’s an interesting use of taps, and various string sounds, which are obfuscated by layering them in such a way that they seem to be mechanical, like the insides of a clock working.\n","date":"11 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-12-29-concrete-music/","section":"All articles","summary":"","title":"Musical Concrete","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"My work","summary":"","title":"My work","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/adrian-de-lima/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Adrian De Lima","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/composer/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Composer","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/film-score/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Film Score","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/logic-pro/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Logic Pro","type":"tags"},{"content":"For my final year composition class at the University of Birmingham I was tasked with rewriting the music for the trailer to Oppenheimer. I wrote this in \u0026ldquo;Logic Pro\u0026rdquo;, using a mixture of Kontakt instruments, and the \u0026ldquo;Vital synth\u0026rdquo; engine. I\u0026rsquo;ve finally decided to share it here.\nAll the rights to the visuals fall Universal Pictures as the original rights holders.\nRescored Trailer # For a comparison here\u0026rsquo;s the original trailer:\nOriginal Trailer # I began my scoring for the trailer by creating a tempo map. I marked out scene transitions using a marker track, making sure to lock the SMPTE time of the markers. I then adjusted the tempo so that scene transitions predominantly aligned with beats. There were quite a lot of changes to the time signature required to remove or add beats where that helped reduce large shifts in tempo, as I aimed to avoid variations greater than 30bpm over the course of the piece.\nThe marker and tempo tracks The piece is scored for hybrid-orchestra (or traditional orchestra and synthesizer, with a lot of SFX and synth pads used throughout), reflecting the thematic material of Robert Oppenheimer pushing technology to its limits to bring us into the nuclear age. I used a deep Pharlight synth whenever the bomb was onscreen (beginning at 0:37) to create an uneasy atmosphere, reflecting the dark history of nuclear weapons.\nThe second half of the trailer uses a metronomic drumbeat to symbolize the driving force behind technological advancement, and the incessant countdown to the first nuclear test. The piece is structured in three distinct sections, building in intensity throughout its duration. It opens with sparce strings, which grow with the addition of basses, and celli. The brass join alongside the lower strings, with a rising melody consisting of long held notes.\nKey scene transitions are highlighted with a high-pitched ping created using a highly processed piano patch, alongside a lot of reverb. The ping anticipates the percussion, and helps to create an airy atmosphere, similar to the beginning of Sebastian Haas’ Last Days of Earth (Last Days of Earth, published by Immediate Music). With the first percussion hit of the piece at 0:28 the brass crescendos to a mini climax as the trailer shows a wall of fire. The percussion begins to gain momentum with the transition to a drone shot of the desert at 0:32. I used a combination of Armageddon drums, Action Strikes, and Ferrum drum patches combined with delays and reverbs to give different sounds and rhythms to the drums throughout the piece. I experimented with lining up percussive hits with the trailer beats, like at 0:43 where the percussion lines up with each collision of a fireball, ending in a larger hit coinciding with the fire cloud. The percussion hits serve as a transition at 0:45 to a driving synth rhythm which makes use of an arpeggiator, serving as the backdrop to a clearer melodic line on a haunting Ashlight synth patch. This melody builds towards the climax at 1:19, where the main melodic motif for the piece is heard, consisting of falling sixths, similar to Göransson’s original violin melody for the trailer. Following the sixths is a descending scale with the brass and strings crescendoing towards the title card. Flutes are introduced here as well, to support the upper strings, and basses are reintroduced.\nWith the climax I aimed to create an expansive orchestration, drawing inspiration from the likes of Gianfranco Pedroli’s United We Stand for the use of a loud, harsh, Vital synth, doubled by brass, and accompanied by a soaring upper string section. 1:41 is composed in a free rhythm so that the explosive hits fit the trailer’s scene transitions, followed byt he reintroduction of the metronomic percussion straight afterwards, to bring the trailer to a close with a series of percussive fills, and a massive hit directly on the title card.\nMy goal with this composition was to match the atmosphereric tension of the trailer, while also building in intensity, through layering instruments, and increasing the complexity of the orchestration as the piece progresses. While the piece does work on its own, it is first and foremost composed with the SFX of the trailer in mind. It\u0026rsquo;s written in D minor, heavily emphasizing chords I, III, V and VI. Despite this, however, the tonality is quite ambiguous at points, especially in the opening, and the arpeggiated synth sections.\n","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-12-29-oppenheimer-trailer-rescored/","section":"All articles","summary":"","title":"Oppenheimer Trailer Rescored","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/orchestral/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Orchestral","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/brazil/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Brazil","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/christmas/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Christmas","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/italy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Italy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/kevin/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Kevin","type":"tags"},{"content":" Playlists ","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/music-videos/","section":"My work","summary":"","title":"Music Videos","type":"categories"},{"content":" See Amid the Winter Snow # Merry Christmas!\nWe hope you enjoy our rendition of the popular carol See Amid the Winter Snow, arranged by yours truly.

His \u0026lsquo;Mother and Child by the Sea\u0026rsquo; was painted during a difficult time in his life, not long after the deaths of a lot of his family, and the same year that his great friend and inspiration Caspar Friedrich passed away. Some see the work as a homage to his friend, or as a reference to his own childhood, waiting for his father to return from his fishing trips 2.\nThe painting # Dahl, Johan Christian Clausen; Mother and Child by the Sea; The Barber Institute of Fine Arts The painting is on a small canvas, in a way inviting the viewer in for a closer, more intimate viewing experience. It depicts the silhouettes a woman and child waiting for a fishing boat to return. I love the contrast between the cold moonlight and the shadowy landscape, as it leaves a lot of the details of the scene up to one’s imagination. The child appears to be excited, but we can’t tell what the mother’s attitude is and there’s no way of knowing whether the trip has been successful or not.\nIn my own compositional response to the painting I wanted to create an impression of a natural landscape from sampled sounds, and then, similarly to how Dahl uses light to obscure details and ignite the imagination, abstract the sonic landscape with further processing.\nProgramme Notes # The small painting invites the viewer closer for a more intimate look. As one views the scene, the sound of waves appears. Shades of darkness and light envelope both the visual and sonic world, as sound recalls the memories of a childhood spent in the outdoors.\nMy compositional response to Johan Christian Dahl’s painting Mother and Child by the Sea, created using sampled audio and electroacoustic processing techniques, explores the ideas of memory and nostalgia within the painting. It takes the listener on a journey from the recognisable shoreline, to an abstract sonic world via electronic processing, combined with hints, or memories, of a natural scene.\nA photo of the painting in the Barber Institute of Arts Compositional Notes # Dahl painted the Mother and Child by the Sea while living abroad in Germany, not long after the deaths of his wife and three children, and the same year his good friend C.D. Friedrich passed. I’ve always seen this painting as quite a forlorn work, with its eery moonlight peaking from behind dark storm clouds on a strangely still ocean. While I was composing for the piece, however, I came to look at it under the light of nostalgia rather than forlornness.\nThe painting depicts a scene where a mother and her child watch a fishing boat, presumably piloted by the father, come up to the shoreline, with the child excitedly pointing towards the boat. As I researched the work I considered two main interpretations of the scene. My first idea, based on the context the work was painted around, was that the painting might represent a journey into the afterlife with his own wife and child watching, or perhaps waiting for someone like Dahl himself arriving in the boat. My second interpretation, and ultimately the one I settled on for my compositional response, is that of Dahl and his mother excitedly waiting for his father to return home from a fishing trip, a nostalgic view of his past, and his homeland in Norway.\nI began my composition with a quite literal sonic representation of the painting, a crafted seascape, created from sampled audio. I used a variety of samples from a water bottle, some rocks, a rain stick and a saltshaker, combined with processing effects, such as freezing and stretching to abstract the sounds from their source. I used this processing to create long textural sounds which I layered and shaped into waves and shoal via EQ automation.\nThe advantage I found from synthesizing my seascape instead of doing a field recording of the sea, was that I could easily transition my various elements and layers into a more processed sound world over the course of the piece, slowly increasing the amount of processing on the various layers.\nThe piece follows a journey, beginning with the listener observing the shoreline, and hearing the mother’s laboured footsteps approach, quickly followed by the excited child rushing through the gravelly beach. The listener’s viewpoint is then taken under the water, where one begins to hear a more alien sound world. I associated the deep bass groanings with the sound of the boat, from an underwater viewpoint. This middle section is much more heavily processed, dipping between the abstract and the less abstract in such a way as to mimic that lucid state when one is half awake, or perhaps, drowning. In the middle section I introduce the idea of memory, harking back to Dahl’s nostalgia for his homeland, with the inclusion of faint birdsong, like one might hear in a forest glade or mountain valley, in contrast to the seagulls heard at the beginning. The piece ends as it began, returning to the surface, to the shoreline, and to the recognisable world.\nAdrian de Lima · Some source sounds\nRepublished from here and here (Archive.org).\n","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-11-14-a-mother-and-child-by-the-sea/","section":"All articles","summary":"","title":"A Mother and Child by the Sea","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/dahl/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dahl","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/johan-christian-dahl/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Johan Christian Dahl","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mother-and-child-by-the-sea/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mother and Child by the Sea","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Music","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/painting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Painting","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sound/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sound","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/neusymar/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Neusymar","type":"tags"},{"content":" Malotte\u0026rsquo;s The Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer # Composed in 1935 by Albert Hay Malotte, The Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer sets the classic prayer given by Christ in Matthew 6 to song.

Lyrics # Our Father, Which art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come Thy will be done, On earth As it is In Heaven. Give us this day, Our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we Forgive our debtors. And lead us not Into temptation. But deliver us from evil. For thine Is the Kingdom, And the power, And the glory, Forever, Amen.

It uses a variety of recorded harmonic sounds that are manipulated to create an atmospheric piece in the style of Monty Adkins.\nCompositional Notes # At the time of composing I was greatly inspired by the work of Monty Adkins in his first of five panels entitled To Luke. Determined to compose a piece in a similar style, I decided on guitar harmonics as a basis.\nThe Musings of a Guitarist opens with fairly unaltered natural harmonics, played on an acoustic guitar, which then transitions to an electric guitar, with increased alterations to the sound. I experimented a lot with bringing sound material in and out of focus by repeating melodic material with a narrower frequency spectrum. This allows the piece to progress from clean opening harmonics, to a hazy wash of conflicting harmonic sounds towards the end. As a contrast to this wash of sound, I used different timbral elements of the guitar, such as tapping the body, or playing above the nut to create a more percussive texture.\nTechnical Details # I began this composition with a recording session. I enlisted the help of a friend who plays guitar, and we went into the studio and recorded a series of sounds from an electric guitar, an acoustic guitar, and a violin. These consisting mostly of harmonics, but there were also some useful miscellaneous sounds extracted from the session, such as rubbing the wood of the instrument.\nThe session was then cut in REAPER to separate the elements out into individual bites and create a sound library. After the original sound bites, consisting mostly of one-shots were cut, I proceeded to generate more textural elements through post processing, using various GRM plugins, PaulxStretch, Cecilia 5 and TS2 to stretch and manipulate the sounds into something almost unrecognisable. Examples can be heard here.\nAll in all I ended up with 293 individual sound bites, only a small fraction of which were used in the final composition.\nI then began to collage the sounds into chunks, which were then treated as melodic phrases when fitted into the structure of the whole piece. The entire piece is composed in REAPER\nA Screenshot of a phrase of the electric guitar melodic material I used a lot of low frequency material to act as an underlying bass for these phrases, to give the piece more of a sense of cohesion.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a significant amount of automated panning in the piece, with background material rotating around the listene creating a sense of 3D space (Listen to the violin pizzicato material at 1.35 with headphones and see how it rotates around the listener\u0026rsquo;s head). All mixing in the project was done via volume automation aswell, so that individual sound items could be mixed in the session instead of the entire track.\nScreenshot of the project mixer, with the parent folder tracks collapsed The structure starts fairly natural with sparse acoustic guitar harmonics over a low frequency bass. This gradually builds over in complexity over the runtime of the piece.\nScreenshot of the opening harmonic melody material Some clicky material created from tapping the guitar is used as a stark contrast to the the flute-like harmonics. The middle of the piece features a lot of stretched harmonics, creating textures that last longer than the natural decay of the harmoncis. The electric guitar starting at 1.27 features a lot of reversed material and reverb, obscuring the initial attack of the notes, making it sound more like a synthesizer than a guitar. This only gets more prominant as you approach the midpoint, and the electric guitar features more heavily. The piece ends with a very stretched out, almost never-ending, singular harmonic, to create the idea that the guitarist keeps on musing into eternity.\n","date":"29 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-12-29-the-musings-of-a-guitarist/","section":"All articles","summary":"","title":"The Musings of a Guitarist","type":"posts"},{"content":" Ripples of Sunshine # Adrian de Lima · Ripples of Sunshine Compositional Notes # This is one of my first forays into MIDI composition. I primarily used Spitfire Audio LABS and Logic Pro instruments.\nThe brief was \u0026ldquo;ambient listening\u0026rdquo;, so I decided to go for soft strings playing pizzicato and harmonics in the first half, and synthesizers in the second half. The cello melody was made using the LABS Cello Moods, a patch that changes pitch depending on the length of the note, allowing the rapid creation of seemingly complex melodies, from not very many notes at all.\n","date":"7 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-12-30-ripples-of-sunshine/","section":"All articles","summary":"","title":"Ripples of Sunshine","type":"posts"},{"content":"Music has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. I was fortunate enough to have parents brave enough to sacrifice their time, money (and ears) for me to be heavily involved in music making throughout my childhood, taking violin and piano lessons at a local music school in Mallorca, Spain where we were living at the time. Upon moving to the UK, I continued my studies of music at secondary school, leading pursuit of my passion at the University of Birmingham where I graduated with my bachelor’s in music in 2025, specializing in performance and electronic composition.\nMy journey into music technology began during a period working as a performing arts technician at my old school. Going in with little to no experience in sound tech, I quickly learned that there’s more to a microphone than just plugging it in, and that sparked an ongoing fascination with sound design and recording. Since then, I’ve been mixing, composing, and experimenting with tech to bring my ideas to life, going so far as to structure a majority of my degree around recording and manipulating sound. Previous Next What really drives me is sharing my music with others and providing the means for music to inspire them. I believe in everyone should have the opportunity to follow their dream and think there’s something incredibly rewarding about supporting others in pursuing their passions, whether it\u0026rsquo;s through collaboration, mentorship, or just sharing knowledge along the way.\nCheck out my work here Contact Me ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/aboutme/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"About me","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"If you would like to get in touch with me, you can find me at the following socials:\nInstagram LinkedIn My music can be found on the following platforms:\nYoutube Soundcloud Spotify Or for business/booking enquiries, email me below:\nEmail me ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Contact page","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
