I wrote this in \u0026ldquo;Logic Pro\u0026rdquo;, using a mixture of Kontakt instruments, and the \u0026ldquo;Vital synth\u0026rdquo; engine. I\u0026rsquo;ve finally decided to share it here.\nAll the rights to the visuals fall Universal Pictures as the original rights holders.\nRescored Trailer # For a comparison here\u0026rsquo;s the original trailer:\nOriginal Trailer # I began my scoring for the trailer by creating a tempo map. I marked out scene transitions using a marker track, making sure to lock the SMPTE time of the markers. I then adjusted the tempo so that scene transitions predominantly aligned with beats. There were quite a lot of changes to the time signature required to remove or add beats where that helped reduce large shifts in tempo, as I aimed to avoid variations greater than 30bpm over the course of the piece.\nThe marker and tempo tracks The piece is scored for hybrid-orchestra (or traditional orchestra and synthesizer, with a lot of SFX and synth pads used throughout), reflecting the thematic material of Robert Oppenheimer pushing technology to its limits to bring us into the nuclear age. I used a deep Pharlight synth whenever the bomb was onscreen (beginning at 0:37) to create an uneasy atmosphere, reflecting the dark history of nuclear weapons.\nThe second half of the trailer uses a metronomic drumbeat to symbolize the driving force behind technological advancement, and the incessant countdown to the first nuclear test. The piece is structured in three distinct sections, building in intensity throughout its duration. It opens with sparce strings, which grow with the addition of basses, and celli. The brass join alongside the lower strings, with a rising melody consisting of long held notes.\nKey scene transitions are highlighted with a high-pitched ping created using a highly processed piano patch, alongside a lot of reverb. The ping anticipates the percussion, and helps to create an airy atmosphere, similar to the beginning of Sebastian Haas’ Last Days of Earth (Last Days of Earth, published by Immediate Music). With the first percussion hit of the piece at 0:28 the brass crescendos to a mini climax as the trailer shows a wall of fire. The percussion begins to gain momentum with the transition to a drone shot of the desert at 0:32. I used a combination of Armageddon drums, Action Strikes, and Ferrum drum patches combined with delays and reverbs to give different sounds and rhythms to the drums throughout the piece. I experimented with lining up percussive hits with the trailer beats, like at 0:43 where the percussion lines up with each collision of a fireball, ending in a larger hit coinciding with the fire cloud. The percussion hits serve as a transition at 0:45 to a driving synth rhythm which makes use of an arpeggiator, serving as the backdrop to a clearer melodic line on a haunting Ashlight synth patch. This melody builds towards the climax at 1:19, where the main melodic motif for the piece is heard, consisting of falling sixths, similar to Göransson’s original violin melody for the trailer. Following the sixths is a descending scale with the brass and strings crescendoing towards the title card. Flutes are introduced here as well, to support the upper strings, and basses are reintroduced.\nWith the climax I aimed to create an expansive orchestration, drawing inspiration from the likes of Gianfranco Pedroli’s United We Stand for the use of a loud, harsh, Vital synth, doubled by brass, and accompanied by a soaring upper string section. 1:41 is composed in a free rhythm so that the explosive hits fit the trailer’s scene transitions, followed byt he reintroduction of the metronomic percussion straight afterwards, to bring the trailer to a close with a series of percussive fills, and a massive hit directly on the title card.\nMy goal with this composition was to match the atmosphereric tension of the trailer, while also building in intensity, through layering instruments, and increasing the complexity of the orchestration as the piece progresses. While the piece does work on its own, it is first and foremost composed with the SFX of the trailer in mind. It\u0026rsquo;s written in D minor, heavily emphasizing chords I, III, V and VI. Despite this, however, the tonality is quite ambiguous at points, especially in the opening, and the arpeggiated synth sections.\n","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-12-29-oppenheimer-trailer-rescored/","section":"All articles","summary":"","title":"Oppenheimer Trailer Rescored","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/orchestral/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Orchestral","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/brazil/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Brazil","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/christmas/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Christmas","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/italy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Italy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/kevin/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Kevin","type":"tags"},{"content":" Playlists ","date":"29 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/music-videos/","section":"My work","summary":"","title":"Music Videos","type":"categories"},{"content":" See Amid the Winter Snow # Merry Christmas!\nWe hope you enjoy our rendition of the popular carol See Amid the Winter Snow, arranged by yours truly.

His \u0026lsquo;Mother and Child by the Sea\u0026rsquo; was painted during a difficult time in his life, not long after the deaths of a lot of his family, and the same year that his great friend and inspiration Caspar Friedrich passed away. Some see the work as a homage to his friend, or as a reference to his own childhood, waiting for his father to return from his fishing trips 2.\nThe painting # Dahl, Johan Christian Clausen; Mother and Child by the Sea; The Barber Institute of Fine Arts The painting is on a small canvas, in a way inviting the viewer in for a closer, more intimate viewing experience. It depicts the silhouettes a woman and child waiting for a fishing boat to return. I love the contrast between the cold moonlight and the shadowy landscape, as it leaves a lot of the details of the scene up to one’s imagination. The child appears to be excited, but we can’t tell what the mother’s attitude is and there’s no way of knowing whether the trip has been successful or not.\nIn my own compositional response to the painting I wanted to create an impression of a natural landscape from sampled sounds, and then, similarly to how Dahl uses light to obscure details and ignite the imagination, abstract the sonic landscape with further processing.\nProgramme Notes # The small painting invites the viewer closer for a more intimate look. As one views the scene, the sound of waves appears. Shades of darkness and light envelope both the visual and sonic world, as sound recalls the memories of a childhood spent in the outdoors.\nMy compositional response to Johan Christian Dahl’s painting Mother and Child by the Sea, created using sampled audio and electroacoustic processing techniques, explores the ideas of memory and nostalgia within the painting. It takes the listener on a journey from the recognisable shoreline, to an abstract sonic world via electronic processing, combined with hints, or memories, of a natural scene.\nA photo of the painting in the Barber Institute of Arts Compositional Notes # Dahl painted the Mother and Child by the Sea while living abroad in Germany, not long after the deaths of his wife and three children, and the same year his good friend C.D. Friedrich passed. I’ve always seen this painting as quite a forlorn work, with its eery moonlight peaking from behind dark storm clouds on a strangely still ocean. While I was composing for the piece, however, I came to look at it under the light of nostalgia rather than forlornness.\nThe painting depicts a scene where a mother and her child watch a fishing boat, presumably piloted by the father, come up to the shoreline, with the child excitedly pointing towards the boat. As I researched the work I considered two main interpretations of the scene. My first idea, based on the context the work was painted around, was that the painting might represent a journey into the afterlife with his own wife and child watching, or perhaps waiting for someone like Dahl himself arriving in the boat. My second interpretation, and ultimately the one I settled on for my compositional response, is that of Dahl and his mother excitedly waiting for his father to return home from a fishing trip, a nostalgic view of his past, and his homeland in Norway.\nI began my composition with a quite literal sonic representation of the painting, a crafted seascape, created from sampled audio. I used a variety of samples from a water bottle, some rocks, a rain stick and a saltshaker, combined with processing effects, such as freezing and stretching to abstract the sounds from their source. I used this processing to create long textural sounds which I layered and shaped into waves and shoal via EQ automation.\nThe advantage I found from synthesizing my seascape instead of doing a field recording of the sea, was that I could easily transition my various elements and layers into a more processed sound world over the course of the piece, slowly increasing the amount of processing on the various layers.\nThe piece follows a journey, beginning with the listener observing the shoreline, and hearing the mother’s laboured footsteps approach, quickly followed by the excited child rushing through the gravelly beach. The listener’s viewpoint is then taken under the water, where one begins to hear a more alien sound world. I associated the deep bass groanings with the sound of the boat, from an underwater viewpoint. This middle section is much more heavily processed, dipping between the abstract and the less abstract in such a way as to mimic that lucid state when one is half awake, or perhaps, drowning. In the middle section I introduce the idea of memory, harking back to Dahl’s nostalgia for his homeland, with the inclusion of faint birdsong, like one might hear in a forest glade or mountain valley, in contrast to the seagulls heard at the beginning. The piece ends as it began, returning to the surface, to the shoreline, and to the recognisable world.\nAdrian de Lima · Some source sounds\nRepublished from here and here (Archive.org).\n","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-11-14-a-mother-and-child-by-the-sea/","section":"All articles","summary":"","title":"A Mother and Child by the Sea","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/dahl/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dahl","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/johan-christian-dahl/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Johan Christian Dahl","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mother-and-child-by-the-sea/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mother and Child by the Sea","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Music","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/painting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Painting","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sound/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sound","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/neusymar/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Neusymar","type":"tags"},{"content":" Malotte\u0026rsquo;s The Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer # Composed in 1935 by Albert Hay Malotte, The Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer sets the classic prayer given by Christ in Matthew 6 to song.

I was fortunate enough to have parents brave enough to sacrifice their time, money (and ears) for me to be heavily involved in music making throughout my childhood, taking violin and piano lessons at a local music school in Mallorca, Spain where we were living at the time. Upon moving to the UK, I continued my studies of music at secondary school, leading pursuit of my passion at the University of Birmingham where I graduated with my bachelor’s in music in 2025, specializing in performance and electronic composition.\nMy journey into music technology began during a period working as a performing arts technician at my old school. Going in with little to no experience in sound tech, I quickly learned that there’s more to a microphone than just plugging it in, and that sparked an ongoing fascination with sound design and recording. Since then, I’ve been mixing, composing, and experimenting with tech to bring my ideas to life, going so far as to structure a majority of my degree around recording and manipulating sound. Previous Next What really drives me is sharing my music with others and providing the means for music to inspire them. I believe in everyone should have the opportunity to follow their dream and think there’s something incredibly rewarding about supporting others in pursuing their passions, whether it\u0026rsquo;s through collaboration, mentorship, or just sharing knowledge along the way.\nCheck out my work here Contact Me ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/aboutme/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"About me","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"If you would like to get in touch with me, you can find me at the following socials:\nInstagram LinkedIn My music can be found on the following platforms:\nYoutube Soundcloud Spotify Or for business/booking enquiries, email me below:\nEmail me ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Contact page","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
